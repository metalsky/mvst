| 1.0 Introduction |
+------------------+

MontaVista Linux 5.0 Technical Preview ("Technical Preview")
provides the current kernel for all MontaVista Linux 5.0
Editions. 

Technical Preview is packaged as a pre-installed environment
to allow for review and evaluation of the upcoming product
release. It contains only a subset of the packages that will
be available in the product editions.

Technical Preview is configured to boot in a VMware Player
under either a Linux host or a Windows host environment. The 
basic configuration includes IDE disk support and the E1000
networking driver.

+--------------------------+
| 2.0 Features and Support |
+--------------------------+

Technical Preview provides a 2.6.18 Linux kernel
based on the 586 MontaVista Linux 5.0 toolchain
for X86/IA-32 architectures.

This kernel configuration is a generic and not
specific to any target board. The disk and Ethernet
drivers are part of the kernel.

Note: Technical Preview is considered a preview and
therefore does not receive technical support from MontaVista
Software, Inc.

+--------------------------+
| 3.0 Requirements         |
+--------------------------+

Before you can use technical preview, a VMware product such as
VMware Player must be installed on your system.

The VMware Player is available at the VMware site:

http://www.vmware.com

The following players have been tested with Technical Preview:

	* VMware Player 1.0.1 Windows
	* VMware Player 1.0.2 Linux
	* VMware Player 1.0.3 Linux
	* VMware Player 1.0.3 Windows

Technical Preview should also work on the equivalent versions of other
VMware products.

+----------------+
| 4.0 Installing |
+----------------+

After you install the player, decompress the 
TechPreview.zip file. Place the contents in a directory
and remember the location. You will need to locate them 
when you start VMware Player.

Note: Verify that networking is enabled in VMWare Player before you
begin booting Technical Preview.

+-------------------------------+
| 5.0 Booting Technical Preview |
+-------------------------------+

To boot the Technical Preview kernel on your target, complete
the following steps:

1. Start the VMware Player. It will prompt you to select a file.

2. Browse to the TechPreview.vmx file and open it. Technical 
   Preview will launch.

3. At the initial prompt, login as root and do not enter a
   password.

+------------------+
| 6.0 Known Issues |
+------------------+

The following issues have been found in Technical Preview:

1. The kernel may hesitate for several seconds as it boots, after 
   displaying the following message:  

   "Checking if this processor honours the WP bit even in supervisor mode"

   This is a known issue for the VMware Player when working with 2.6.18
   kernels.

2. Some of the configuration utilities (i.e. initdconfig for example)
   only work to add or remove the configuration but do not support
   the --list function.

3. SSH key generation may not work correctly.
